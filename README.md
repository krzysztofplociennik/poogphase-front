**Description**

The project is sort of a clone of Facebook. It is a very simple implementation, but it still inherits fundamental functionalities like creating a post, comment or adding a friend.

Please note that the project is in a very early stage and as of now I just want to show basic functions and view. More things are coming soon.

My focus right now would be to create a login and registration forms.

This repository represents the frontend of this project.
The backend part is here: https://github.com/krzysztofplociennik/poogphase

**Current Stack**

- Java
- Spring Boot
- Hibernate
- H2 Database
- Vaadin
